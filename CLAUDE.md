```

## Current State

This project is newly initialized. No application code, build system, or dependencies have been added yet. The sections below should be updated as the project evolves.

## Getting Started

_To be updated once a tech stack and build system are chosen._

### Prerequisites

- TBD (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.)

### Install Dependencies

```sh
# TBD
```

### Run the Application

```sh
# TBD
```

### Run Tests

```sh
# TBD
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `master` — main branch
- Feature branches should use descriptive names

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in imperative mood (e.g., "Add slot reel component", "Fix payout calculation")

## Code Conventions

_To be defined as the project takes shape. Update this section with:_

- Language and framework choices
- Linting and formatting rules
- Naming conventions
- File and folder organization patterns

## Key Architecture Notes

_To be documented as architecture decisions are made. Typical areas to cover for a slot demo:_

- Game engine / state management approach
- Reel and symbol configuration
- Payout table and win-line logic
- RNG / randomness strategy
- UI rendering approach (Canvas, DOM, WebGL, etc.)
- UK Gambling Commission compliance considerations (if applicable)

## Testing

_To be documented once a test framework is selected._

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When working in this repository:

1. **Read before editing** — always read a file before modifying it.
2. **Keep changes minimal** — only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary.
3. **Update this file** — when adding new build commands, dependencies, or architectural patterns, update the relevant sections of this CLAUDE.md.
4. **Respect existing patterns** — follow whatever conventions are established in the codebase rather than introducing new ones.
5. **No over-engineering** — prefer simple, direct implementations. Avoid premature abstractions.
